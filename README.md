##Project Name: Image Analysis and Difference Detection

##Overview:

This project aims to provide a tool for analyzing images and detecting differences among them. Whether you're comparing versions of a design, searching for variances in medical images, or identifying alterations in satellite imagery, this tool offers a streamlined solution.

##Features:

Image Comparison: Analyze two or more images to identify variations, variations, and inconsistencies.
Difference Detection: Highlight variations between images, pinpointing variations in pixels, colors, shapes, or structures.
Flexible Input: Accepts various image formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP.
Customization: Adjust settings to tailor the analysis to specific needs, such as sensitivity to color variations or tolerance for structural differences.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and high-resolution images efficiently.

##Usage:

Input Images: Provide the images you want to compare as input to the tool.
Run Analysis: Execute the analysis script, specifying the input images.
Review Results: Examine the output to identify and understand the differences detected.
Installation: Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Ensure compatible versions of Python and required libraries are installed.

##Dependencies:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy

##How to Run:
